       <li>Alan Turing, born London 23 June 1912 - 7 June 1954 </li>
       <li>Considered a father of modern day computing</li>
       <li>A computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and theoretical            biologist </li>
       <li>When WW2 broke out he took a leading role in deciphering the German ciphers            out of Bletchley Park.</li>
       <li>It is postulated that due to his role in helping crack the enigma codes the war was shortened by 2-4 years and 14 to 28 millions lives were saved</li>
       <li>He was found dead by his cleaner on 8 June 1954. He had died the day before of cyanide poisoning, a half-eaten apple beside his bed.</li>
       <li>It is still a mystery whether he committed suicide, was killed or accidentally poisoned himself whilst using cyanide in amateur chemistry experiments.

       <p>"Sometimes it is the people no one can imagine anything of who do the things no one can imagine.”
       <br/>― Alan Turing</p>
