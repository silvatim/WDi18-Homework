       <p> The BOMBE was the name of an electro-mechanical machine, developed during WWII by Alan Turing and Gordon Welchman,
       whilst working as codebreakers at Bletchley Park. It was used to help breaking the German Enigma codes and was
       (partly) based on the so-called BOMBA, an earlier machine developed by Polish mathematicians in 1938.
       From 1943 onwards, an improved version of the 4-wheel BOMBE was built in the US by the US Navy and, separately,
       by the US Army.</p>

       <p>Based on the information presented by the Poles, British mathematician Alan Turing developed a machine that was
       capable of recovering the key settings even if the Germans would drop the double encryption of the message key at
       the beginning of each message. The machine was called Bombe (later: Turing-Welchman Bombe)</p>

       <p>In the UK, all British Bombes were destroyed or dismantled once the war was over. As far as we know,
       not a single machine has survived. This has triggered a group of enthusiasts to start a rebuilding project in the mid-1990s.
       The aim of the project was to recreate a fully functional replica, which was completed in 2007</p>
